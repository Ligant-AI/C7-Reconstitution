/**
 * Path-based router for benchtools.ligant.ai/reconstitution/*.
 *
 * The Reconstitution tool is deployed as its own Cloudflare Pages project
 * (ligant-reconstitution), separate from the ADC's own project
 * (ligant-tools), which owns the benchtools.ligant.ai custom domain directly.
 * This Worker is bound to a route matching only the /reconstitution path
 * on that same zone, so it intercepts just those requests; everything else on
 * the domain falls through to the ADC's Pages project untouched.
 *
 * The Reconstitution tool's own build uses relative asset paths (base: './'),
 * so it does not matter to the browser that it is served from a sub-path
 * instead of a domain root: what matters here is that this Worker strips the
 * /reconstitution prefix before forwarding, since the upstream Pages
 * project serves the same files at its own root.
